📊 Financial Ratio Analysis & Performance Benchmarking

📄 Project Overview

This project focuses on the quantitative assessment of a company's financial health through Ratio Analysis. Using an integrated 3-statement model as the foundation, this analysis evaluates liquidity, solvency, operational efficiency, and profitability over a 7-year horizon (3 years of historical data and a 5-year forecast). The goal is to transform standard accounting figures into meaningful insights regarding the company's risk profile and growth potential.

🏗️ Project Structure

The analysis is layered to ensure a clear "Data $\rightarrow$ Metric $\rightarrow$ Insight" workflow:The Core Model (The Input):P&L & BS: Integrated statements that provide the raw numerators and denominators for all calculations (Revenue, EBIT, Net Income, Total Assets, etc.).Operational Efficiency (Working Capital):Located at the bottom of the BS tab, tracking key metrics like Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO), and Days Payable Outstanding (DPO).Capital Structure & Solvency:Financial Liabilities: A dedicated schedule used to calculate interest coverage and debt-to-equity implications.Profitability Analysis:Margin analysis (Gross, EBITDA, and Net Profit margins) integrated directly into the P&L forecast to track performance under different scenarios.

🔍 Key Findings

Profitability Expansion: The Net Profit Margin saw a massive improvement by 2016, with Net Income reaching $303.2$ million, setting a high baseline for the forecast period.Efficiency Stability: The model projects stabilized Inventory Days (DIO) and Receivable Days (DSO) through 2021, suggesting optimized supply chain management.Solvency Risk: With an initial debt of $615.8$ million and a 9% interest rate, the analysis monitors the interest coverage ratio to ensure the "Best Case" scenario maintains adequate cushion for repayments.Growth Trajectory: Under the best-case forecast, the return on assets and equity is expected to trend upward as Net Income is projected to hit $402.1$ million by 2021.🛠️ Tools & Techniques UsedFinancial Modeling: Building the 3-statement architecture required for holistic ratio calculation.DuPont Analysis Components: Breaking down Return on Equity (ROE) by tracking margins, asset turnover, and financial leverage.Scenario Stress-Testing: Using a "Scenario Toggle" to see how ratios (like the Debt Service Coverage Ratio) fluctuate under different business conditions.Vertical & Horizontal Analysis: Comparing line items as a percentage of sales and tracking year-over-year growth rates.

🚀 How to Use

Analyze Efficiency: Navigate to the BS tab to view the Working Capital Ratios. These drive the cash flow assumptions for the forecast.Toggle Performance: Change the scenario in cell C3 of the P&L tab. Observe how profitability ratios (e.g., Net Margin) automatically adjust across the 5-year forecast.Audit Calculations: Review the Workings tab to see how raw bookkeeping entries are categorized to ensure the accuracy of the ratio inputs.

This ratio analysis is for educational and illustrative purposes. The metrics are derived from a hypothetical model and historical assumptions. Financial ratios should not be viewed in isolation; actual investment or credit decisions require a broader qualitative and market-based context.
